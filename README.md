# data_harvesting_project
This project aims to analyze the spatial distribution of public housing and leisure spaces in Madrid using data harvesting techniques

The study comprises three main parts:

## 1. Scrapping Public Housing Data:

Utilizes web scraping techniques, including Selenium, to extract information about public housing from the Empresa Municipal de la Vivienda y Suelo (EMVS) website. Extracts the number of dwellings and the district for each housing development.

## 2. Using Ayuntamiento de Madrid's Datos Abiertos API:

Accesses data about leisure spaces such as theaters, concert halls, cinemas, and parks using the Ayuntamiento de Madrid's Datos Abiertos API, including data extraction, JSON formatting, and location data storage.

## 3. Data Visualization:

Visualizes the distribution of public housing and leisure spots to observe any potential pattern or trend.

- Ensure all necessary packages are available before running the code.
- Have the required district database files available in .dbf, .prj, .shp, and .shx formats for proper map creation.
- Save these files in the same folder as the script or in a location accessible to the script.
